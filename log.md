### Day 10: September 29, 2025

**Today's Progress**:
Refactoring the entire project with DDD and Clean architecture.

**Thoughts:** Every time I do something new I realized that I do something wrong and need to reestrucuter. The good part is that when I will do another project I would know what am I doing.

### Day 13: October 3, 2025

**Today's Progress**:
Administrator and Patient test added.

**Thoughts:** Everytime I do something in my project, I search if I applyied right the DDD architecture, only to find out that I did it wrong, so I went back to rewrite that part of the code and parts that calls it.

### Day 14: October 4, 2025

**Today's Progress**:
Contracting, Delivery days and DTOs Mappers tested.

**Thoughts:** Man, I am tired of learning good practices in DDD-Clean Architecture-CQRS, but I am learning too well, bur failing a lot in the process.

Anyway, it wasn't impossible for me to do the stream like I wanted, but I write some code and that is the important thing.

### Day 15: October 6, 2025

**Today's Progress**:

**Thoughts:** Working with mocks in Go is so much diffrent that in .NET, and so much harder.
